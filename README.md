# csgo-vscripts

This is my collection of vscripts for CS:GO, very inspired by https://github.com/s-ol/csgo-vscripts

## Installation

Copy the `.nut` files into your `csgo/scripts/vscripts` directory;  

## Usage

Scripts are loaded with the `script_execute` console command.

```
script_execute nadeSaver
```

## Scripts

* nadeSaver.nut:  
    - Saves grenades you throw to a hotkey and let's you rethrow them
